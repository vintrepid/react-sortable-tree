Overnight at the Villa Mandarine...BL<br />&#160;<br />The Berbers: Two thirds of Moroccans are Berbers (or Imazighen, as they call themselves), a group with a mixed origin that includes European and Saharan peoples. Not a homogeneous group, the Berbers arrived in Morocco (and other regions of North Africa) at different times. Morocco&#8217;s Berbers found refuge in the High Atlas and Middle Atlas, thus surviving various invasions by Mediterranean civilizations. Today they retain a distinctive tribal culture that breaks into three major groups: the Sanhaja live in the central and eastern High Atlas, the Middle Atlas, and the Rif and speak the Tamazight dialect. The Masmouda are settled people who live mostly in the western High Atlas and speak the Chleuh dialect; it was a Masmoudian tribe that in the 12th century founded the Almohad Empire, a dynasty strong enough to have controlled Spain along with much of northwest Africa. The Zenets, the herders of eastern Morocco, speak the Znatiya dialect. They founded the Marinid Dynasty in the 13th century. The blue-robed Tuaregs of the Sahara are also a branch of the Berber family. Berbers are Muslims, but their conversion to Islam took centuries and in many areas was not dominant until the 16th century. Berber Islam tends to incorporate traditional beliefs of former religious practice.","daynum":1,"photoId":null,"photoPlacement":"","publish":null,"brief":false,"draft":false,"breakfast":true,"lunch":true,"dinner":true,"createdAt":"2018-07-28 14:15:07 -0700","updatedAt":"2018-07-28 14:15:07 -0700"},"relationships":{"trip":{"data":{"id":"23778","type":"departure"}}}},{"id":"5458","type":"tripDay","attributes":{"tripId":23778,"tripType":"Departure","day":"Day 2","title":"Moulay Idriss / Volubilis / Fez","description":"Depart Rabat and travel inland through countryside dotted with wheat fields, vineyards, and olive groves to Moulay Idriss, a rural hill town named for Morocco&#8217;s most famous saint, Moulay Idriss, great-grandson of the Prophet Muhammed.

It refers to Morocco&#8217;s old pre-20th century cities, many of them enclosed within defensive walls. A medina has several monumental gates through which it can be entered and a mosque at its heart. Medinas are separated into quarters according to social and commercial hierarchies. Each quarter usually has its own communal oven, hammam, and grocery shop within its network of streets and alleys. Craftsmen work in the area of the medina known as the souk (market), often with separate souks for separate crafts. A casbah is a fortress-style building with crenelated towers. In rural Morocco, representatives of the ruler lived in and governed from casbahs; a casbah can be inside a ksar. A ksar is a fortified rural village surrounded by solid walls set with crenelated towers.","daynum":3,"photoId":null,"photoPlacement":"","publish":null,"brief":false,"draft":false,"breakfast":true,"lunch":true,"dinner":true,"createdAt":"2018-07-28 14:15:07 -0700","updatedAt":"2018-07-28 14:15:07 -0700"},"relationships":{"trip":{"data":{"id":"23778","type":"departure"}}}},{"id":"5460","type":"tripDay","attributes":{"tripId":23778,"tripType":"Departure","day":"Day 4","title":"Erfoud","description":"Drive across the craggy Middle Atlas Mountains.
