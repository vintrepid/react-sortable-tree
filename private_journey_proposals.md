# Private Journey Proposals

The attached json data is a proposed departure of a [Morocco Private Journey](https://www.wildernesstravel.com/trip/morocco/morocco-private-journey) itinerary. It has a collection of tripDays, both long and brief. We would like to be able to arrange the days with a drag and drop interface.

The data is generated by the [fast_jsonapi gem](https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi). You can normalize it with the [json-api-normalizer](https://github.com/yury-dymov/json-api-normalizer), and access the store with [redux-object](https://github.com/yury-dymov/redux-object), e.g.

```
import normalize from 'json-api-normalizer';
import build from 'redux-object';

function mapStateToProps(state) {
  const normalizeData = normalize(state.data);
  const proposalObj = build(normalizeData, 'proposal', '23778');
```

If you sort the days by not brief and the daynum, you can build a 1 level deep tree with the brief days at the root and the long days as children. We would like to arrange the days something like this (you don't have to use this component):

[React Sortable Tree](https://github.com/frontend-collective/react-sortable-tree)

For each Day, display the day, daynum, and title properties, and a calculated date (or range) including the day of the week. We should be able to delete a day.

As the tree is sorted, we would like to recalculate the day numbers.

We offer 2 extensions. Allow the user to drop an extension into the Day by Day itinerary. The data I'm attaching is missing the extension day by day data. For now, each extension added to the itinerary would add one 3 day long tripDay.
